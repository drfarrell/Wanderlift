            <p>GoFire is Colorado’s newest startup in the medical cannabis space and was looking for both a complete overhaul of their identity and an intuitive iOS app design that integrated with their core product. The challenge with this client was overcoming my complete unfamiliarity with the space while creating a clean medical ethos for the brand.</p>

                GoFire’s primary product interfaces with an iOS device via Bluetooth. The device itself is pretty robust, and handles a large array of customizability for the user on a screenless hardware device. The iOS app would act as the interface, displaying temperature, strand, cannabinoid and terpene profile, device battery life, dosage remaining, and other important stats for the user. The product experience is vast, with features like feedback, usage, stats, and so much more. Given such a behemoth of an app, I started by consolidating the information hierarchy into something digestible.

            <h5>The first iteration</h5>
            <h6>Applying the revised medical brand as well as some of the iOS human interface elements, I was able to modernize the skeuomorphic approach and relieve some UX confusion while maximizing screen space.</h6>

              <p>
                <br>This first iteration used a card-system to represent the unique cartridges and strands you could use. THC vs CBD content is a vital relationship in the experience that defines how someone will react to a given strand, so I put the two stats front-and-center below the title of the strand. I put the battery life of the product and how much substance was left at the top given that those were the two stats I assumed would fluctuate pretty quickly during a typical use period and would guide the availability of usage. I made the top-to-bottom hierarchy from least-controllable to most-controllable, with the most active temperature control at the base of the screen, closer to the thumb. <br><br>
                There were a couple of issues with this iteration. First, the ratio of THC to CBD was not well articulated from the base milligram count. When a user would load a new substance, there wasn’t a good visual indicator as to how the substance is different from the previous one. Second, the temperature control didn’t indicate any point of progress for the product's preparation of the substance and didn’t offer feedback to the user on their temperature selection. Finally, GoFire wanted to incorporate “reasons for dosing” to collect data on how or why the user is dosing at that time. The hue of the color indicators began to take a role as both a key brand element and a utilitarian element, as the spectrum demonstrated at what point in the process the user would be. Purple stood for negative or cautious situations, blue was neutral, and green was positive.

            <h5>Scope modification</h5>
            <h6>Rather than completely revamping the original UX, I applied the indicators, typography, and depth improvements to a more optimized but equally enticing representation of what the hardware device was doing.</h6>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">

              <p>
                <br>Let’s start from the top. I put the product battery life into an icon, the strand name into the title, and an info label-button in the nav bar to relieve a large amount of real estate in the center of the screen for the primary dial. Tag-buttons above the dial are an easy way for a user to select their reasons for dosing or medicating, providing the necessary data capture that GoFire is looking for. The primary dial displays a visual indicator of the THC and CBD ratio for this particular strand. In the center of the dial is the current temperature, dosage size, and number of dosing sessions left with a particular substance. At the base of the dial is a temperature indicator that bubbles-up from the temperature selector, and then reveals a gradient dosing indicator ring around the primary dial. The glowing diamond at the top of the dial indicates the rate that the user is inhaling through the product and transitions from turquoise in the center to purple at the base when a user isn’t inhaling optimally. <br><br>

                GoFire was really excited about these designs, but still had a couple of fine points of detail to correct. Having the percentage of THC and CBD in a strand didn’t help the user discern much about the profile of the strand they had, so I changed the percentages to labels in the lower corners of the dial. The temperature selector didn’t articulate the degree incrementation of the device, and GoFire wanted to have a warning for when the temperature would cause the cannabis to combust. I tried a couple of temperature selector styles and decided to go with large numbers and five-degree increments to keep things cleaner.

            <h5>The final design</h5>
            <h6>With all of the visual improvements solidified, it was time to prioritize UX. I tucked-away nonessential stats into the central circle and made it extremely quick to adjust reasons for dosing with a swipeable card. </h6>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <div class="read-more" onclick="this.classList.add('expanded')">

              <p>
                <br>All of the refinements along the iterations relied on continuous feedback from the hardware team, as one primary feature implied the complete removal of the incremental temperature selector in the center of the screen. The hardware team had repurposed a button on the device to enable the user to toggle between three preset temperatures settings: a low, medium, and high temperature. That meant that incremental changes would only be necessary for communicating the preset temperatures, so I tucked that away in a secondary interaction. To edit the temperature, a user could either tap the “Edit” button in the upper right, or tap and hold on one of the temperature circles. An animation would slide the temperatures into a row and reveal the selector, and tapping away from the bubbles or “Done” in the upper corner would return the screen to the original position. <br><br>

                Another huge adjustment came from the adjusting the frequency of editing “reasons for dosing” or tags. The original plan was to make editing tags a medium-frequency task, but the founders wanted to up the ease of editing tags and refine them down to just three primaries for quick access in the event of swapping cartridges in-and-out of the device quickly. A swipe-up card solution at the lower portion of the screen made for an ultra fast method of accessing and editing tags, and once a user was in the tag search screen, navigation was a breeze. A user could swipe side-to-side to quickly access recent, health, or lifestyle tags, and if swiping around didn’t get the job done, they could always default to searching for a specific tag. The robustness of this solution ensured users were intentional about completing the tag selection, as gathering data on usage is a key part of the GoFire experience and business model. The use of Xs and arrow icons for quick tag importing prioritized the user’s customization as well as speed to completion. The Spotify application was a huge influence on this final iteration, as it showed how intentional and direct copywriting can guide the user through a flow to establish a habit of use, and that small type is perfectly appropriate for creating whitespace and a lightweight experience.

            <h5>Onboarding for two types of users</h5>
            <h6>Specific regulations, user preferences, and account creation forms meant GoFire needed a thorough but engaging approach to introducing their users to the app. </h6>

            <p>
              <br>There are a couple of key things that need to happen with onboarding for a product like this. First, Apple requires users of a cannabis-related product to indicate their date of birth before using the app to keep it out of the hands of kids. The introductory flow asks users what type of user they will be, separating them into the right user bucket which would influence the copy in their experience of the app as well as their available reasons for dosing or medicating.

            <h5>A rich content experience</h5>
            <h6>GoFire’s experience relies on a deep stream of resources for engaging users, and with a disparate amount of information floating around, GoFire needed a central hub for getting the most out of their product. </h6>

              <br>The support section is the primary way for users to get all the information they need to dose well with cannabis. The search functionality is supposed to be extremely robust, allowing users to browse videos, articles, tips, dispensary locations, and other information related to dosing with cannabis. The challenge was to condense it all into an attractive and easily-browsable section of the app that wasn’t overwhelming. A personal introduction welcomed users to browse the full stream of content available to discover more ways to dose with GoFire.

                <br>It’s unsurprising that the original logo for GoFire was hexagonal and sharp, as the hexagon was (and still is) a pretty popular reference to the “new recreational science” of the cannabis industry. I chose the soft logotype for its cleanliness and friendliness,  and three diamonds as an accent on the upper right of the logo to symbolize the vaporizing product that the company produces, and counter-balance the descender of the lowercase g. Finally, I used a soft color palette of turquoise/green, blue, and purple for the brand to differentiate it from stereotypical companies in the cannabis industry that use fairly extreme hues of green.

        <h5>Conclusion</h5>
        <p><br>The GoFire brand is one of the largest projects I’ve ever worked on. Given that I had no knowledge of the industry and no upper design management for feedback or support, I am very proud of the work I’ve shared with you above. There is still quite a bit ahead for this company, and I hope to see the brand grow in the coming months. Be sure to check back on this case study as I share more of my work with GoFire.</p>
